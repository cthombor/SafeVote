This set of ballots was collected in 1988 by Nicolaus Tideman, with support
from NSF grant SES86-18328. &quot;The data are records of ballots from elections
of British organizations (mostly trade unions using PR-STV or IRV voting)
in which the voters ranked the candidates. The data were gathered under a
stipulation that the organizations involved would remain anonymous.&quot;
The ballots were encoded in David Hill's format, and have been converted to
the preference-vector format of this package.  Candidates have been renamed
to letters of the alphabet, for ease of comparison with Table 3 of Tideman,
&quot;Better voting methods through technology: The refinement-manageability
trade-off in the single transferable vote&quot;, Public Choice 103: 13-34, 2000,
DOI: 10.1023/A:1005082925477.
As noted in this table, it is a very close race between candidates D, F,
and B in the final rounds of a Meek count of a53_hil.
Tideman's implementation of Meek's method excludes B (on 59.02 votes), then
elects D in the final round (on 88.33 votes) with a margin of 0.95 votes
ahead of F (on 87.38 votes).
In v1.0, stv(a53.hil,quota.hare=TRUE) excludes F (on 56.418 votes), then
elects D in the final round (on 79.705 votes) with a winning margin of
0.747 votes ahead of B (on 78.958 votes). The result of the election is the
same but the vote counts and winning margins differ significantly; so we
conclude that stv(quota.hare=TRUE) in SafeVote v1.0 is not a reliable
proxy for Tideman's implementation of Meek's algorithm.
Future researchers may wish to adjust the quota calculation of vote.stv()
so that it is no longer biased upward by a &quot;fuzz&quot; of 0.001, to see if this
change significantly reduces the discrepancies with Tideman's
implementation of Meek.
As noted in (Wichmann, 2000), &quot;... an exact
comparison \[ between two implementations of Meek \] cannot be expected
due both to differences in the specification and due to the breaking of
ties.&quot;
In June 2020, a postgraduate student at Edinburgh presented a
slideshow
describing progress toward a formal specification of Meek's algorithm. This
specification, when complete, would support proofs of important properties
-- such as convergence -- and would allow an implementation to be formally
verified for correctness."><title>Tideman a53_hil — a53_hil • SafeVote</title><script src="../deps/jquery-3.6.0/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no"><link href="../deps/bootstrap-5.2.2/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet"><script src="../deps/bootstrap-5.2.2/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script><!-- Font Awesome icons --><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.12.1/css/all.min.css" integrity="sha256-mmgLkCYLUQbXn0B1SRqzHar6dCnv9oZFPEC1g1cwlkk=" crossorigin="anonymous"><link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.12.1/css/v4-shims.min.css" integrity="sha256-wZjR52fzng1pJHwx4aV2AO3yyTOXrcDW7jBpJtTwVxw=" crossorigin="anonymous"><!-- bootstrap-toc --><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/afeld/bootstrap-toc@v1.0.1/dist/bootstrap-toc.min.js" integrity="sha256-4veVQbu7//Lk5TSmc7YV48MxtMy98e26cf5MrgZYnwo=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><!-- headroom.js --><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/headroom/0.11.0/headroom.min.js" integrity="sha256-AsUX4SJE1+yuDu5+mAVzJbuYNPHj/WroHuZ8Ir/CkE0=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/headroom/0.11.0/jQuery.headroom.min.js" integrity="sha256-ZX/yNShbjqsohH1k95liqY9Gd8uOiE1S4vZc+9KQ1K4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><!-- clipboard.js --><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/clipboard.js/2.0.6/clipboard.min.js" integrity="sha256-inc5kl9MA1hkeYUt+EC3BhlIgyp/2jDIyBLS6k3UxPI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><!-- search --><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/fuse.js/6.4.6/fuse.js" integrity="sha512-zv6Ywkjyktsohkbp9bb45V6tEMoWhzFzXis+LrMehmJZZSys19Yxf1dopHx7WzIKxr5tK2dVcYmaCk2uqdjF4A==" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/autocomplete.js/0.38.0/autocomplete.jquery.min.js" integrity="sha512-GU9ayf+66Xx2TmpxqJpliWbT5PiGYxpaG8rfnBEk1LL8l1KGkRShhngwdXK1UgqhAzWpZHSiYPc09/NwDQIGyg==" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mark.js/8.11.1/mark.min.js" integrity="sha512-5CYOlHXGh6QpOFA/TeTylKLWfB3ftPsde7AnmhuitiTX4K5SqCLBeKro6sPS8ilsz1Q4NRx3v8Ko2IBiszzdww==" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><!-- pkgdown --><script src="../pkgdown.js"></script><meta property="og:title" content="Tideman a53_hil — a53_hil"><meta property="og:description" content="This data is one of 87 sets of ballots from the Tideman data collection, as curated by The Center for Range Voting.
