#' @title Tideman a53_hil
#' @docType data
#' @description This data is one of 87 sets of ballots from the Tideman data
#'   collection, as curated by The Center for Range Voting.
#' 
#'   This set of ballots was collected in 1988 by Nicolaus Tideman, with support
#'   from NSF grant SES86-18328. "The data are records of ballots from elections
#'   of British organizations (mostly trade unions using PR-STV or IRV voting)
#'   in which the voters ranked the candidates. The data were gathered under a
#'   stipulation that the organizations involved would remain anonymous."
#'
#'   The ballots were encoded in David Hill's format, and have been converted to
#'   the preference-vector format of this package.  Candidates have been renamed
#'   to letters of the alphabet, for ease of comparison with Table 3 of Tideman
#'   (2000). Note: the DOI for this article is 10.1023/A:1005082925477, with an
#'   embedded colon which isn't handled by the usual DOI-to-URL conversions.
#'   
#'   As noted in this table, it is a very close race between candidates D, F,
#'   and B in the final rounds of a Meek count of 'a53_hil'.  
#'   
#'   Tideman's implementation of Meek's method excludes B (on 59.02 votes), then
#'   elects D in the final round (on 88.33 votes) with a margin of 0.95 votes
#'   ahead of F (on 87.38 votes).  
#'   
#'   In v1.0, 'stv(a53.hil,quota.hare=TRUE)' excludes F (on 56.418 votes), then
#'   elects D in the final round (on 79.705 votes) with a winning margin of
#'   0.747 votes ahead of B (on 78.958 votes). The result of the election is the
#'   same but the vote counts and winning margins differ significantly; so we
#'   conclude that 'stv(quota.hare=TRUE)' in SafeVote v1.0 is *not* a reliable
#'   proxy for Tideman's implementation of Meek's algorithm.
#'   
#'   Future researchers may wish to adjust the quota calculation of 'vote.stv()'
#'   so that it is no longer biased upward by a "fuzz" of 0.001, to see if this
#'   change significantly reduces the discrepancies with Tideman's
#'   implementation of Meek.
#'   
#'   It would be unreasonable to expect an exact replication of results from two
#'   different implementations of an STV method.  We leave it to future
#'   researchers to develop a formal specification, so that it would be possible
#'   to verify the correctness of an implementation.  We also leave it to future
#'   researchers to develop a set of test cases with appropriate levels of
#'   tolerance for the vagaries of floating-point roundoff in optimised (or even
#'   unoptimised!) compilations of the same code on different computing systems.
#'   We suggest that 'a53_hil' be included in any such test set.
#'   
#'   We note in passing that B.A. Wichmann, in "Checking two STV programs",
#'   Voting Matters 11, 2000, discussed the cross-validation exercise he
#'   conducted between the ERBS implementation of its voting rules and the
#'   Church of England's implementation of its voting rules.  In both cases, he
#'   discovered ambiguities in the specification as well as defects in the
#'   implementation.
